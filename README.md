# A personal loan allows you to borrow money from a lender for almost any purpose, 
  typically with a fixed term, a fixed interest rate, and a regular monthly payment schedule. 

# Collateral is usually not required and personal loans typically have lower interest rates than most credit cards.

# Since interest rate and loan terms on a personal loan are fixed, 
  you can select a loan and payment amount that fits within your budget—which is great when you’re consolidating debt. 

# Plus, you’ll know the exact date your loan will be fully paid off. 

# Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. 

# It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), 
  and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. 

# At its height, Lending Club was the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans.
